   University (hereafter "the Group"), on the understanding that the
   Group will foster the development of the dictionary files, and will
   utilize all monies received for use of the files for the further
   development of the files, and for research into computer lexicography
   and electronic dictionaries.

   This document outlines the licence arrangement put in place by The

   3. Licence Conditions

   [2][somerights20.gif] 

   The dictionary files are made available under a Creative Commons
   Attribution-ShareAlike Licence (V3.0). The Licence Deed can be viewed
   [3]here, and the full Licence Code is [4]here. As stated in that
   licence, you "must attribute the work in the manner specified by the
   author or licensor." In the case of these files, you must:
    a. in the case of publishing significant extracts of the files, or
       material based on significant extracts of the files, e.g. in a
       published dictionary or in vocabulary lists, clearly acknowledge
       that you used the files for this purpose;
    b. in the case of a software package or WWW server, etc. which uses
       the files or incorporates data from the files, you must:
         i. acknowledge the usage and source of the files in the
            documentation and publicity material;
        ii. provide copies of the documentation and licence files (in the
            case of software packages);
        iii. provide links to either local copies of the documentation
            and licence files or to the locations of the files at Monash
            University.
            If a WWW server is providing a dictionary function or an
            on-screen display of words from the files, the
            acknowledgement must be made on each screen display, e.g. in
            the form of a message at the foot of the screen or page.
            For the EDICT, JMdict and KANJIDIC files, the following URLs
            may be used or quoted:

   extracts from the files does not remove or in any way diminish the
   Group's copyright over the files.

   restriction placed on commercial use of the files. Where use of the
   files results in a financial return to the user, it is suggested that
