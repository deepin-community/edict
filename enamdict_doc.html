<H4> Introduction</H4>
<P>
The ENAMDICT/JMnedict files contain Japanese proper names; place-names, 
surnames, given names, (some) company names and product names. 
These were originally included in the EDICT file, 
along with other non-name entries. By late 1995, the number of name entries
had exceeded the others, and the file was becoming unmanageably large,
so the decision was made to split it. (The split was done automatically,
and may have been imperfectly performed. Please notify any errors.)
From this split came the ENAMDICT file.
</P>
<P>
The JMnedict (Japanese Multilingual Named Entity Dictionary) is simply
the ENAMDICT file reformatted into an XML file in UTF-8 coding. It also
has a small number of names which use kanji from the JIS X 0212 character set.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<H4> Format</H4>
<P>
The format of the ENAMDICT file is exactly the same as the EDICT file,
and the EDICT documention  should be consulted for more information.
</P>
<P>
Most software which uses the EDICT file can also handle other files, however
there is some software, such as MacJDic, which can only handle a single
file. In such cases, users can concatenate EDICT and ENAMDICT to create
a single file. 
</P>
<P>
Note that with the release of ENAMDICT V97-001, the tagging of names has
now changed. The old (sur), (giv), etc. has been replaced with (mostly)
single-letter codes, without the old redundancies. The codes, as of release 
V2000-01, are:
</P>
<PRE>
s - surname
p - place-name
u - person name, as-yet unclassified
g - given name, as-yet not classified by sex
f - female given name
m - male given name
h - full (family plus given) name of a particular person
pr - product name
co - company name
</PRE>
<P>
In addition, a number of country-names are added in parentheses after
place-names.
</P>
<P>
The JMnedict is structured according to its DTD, which is at the front 
of the file.
