<I>Note: In June 2008 the entries in this file were combined with the full</I>
<I>JMdict/EDICT file, and the terms or senses specific to information </I>
<I>technology and telecommunications were tagged with "{comp}". The file </I>
<I>is now simply a subset of the main EDICt file.</I>
</P>
<P>
The COMPDIC file is a glossary of terms used in the computing and 
(tele)communications industries. It is in the "EDICT" format, and is
intended for use as a generally available file for dictionary and
WP software systems.
</P>
<P>
The following sources of information have been used to compile this
file:
</P>
<OL type="a">
<LI>the identifiable entries in the EDICT file itself;
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI>a large collection of material from the various JIS standards.
This has been extensively edited and reformated. Many are rather
old-fashioned (punched cards - forsooth), and many relate to OSI standards.
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI>an excellent glossary file of telecommunications and computing
terms prepared by Paul Denisowski (pad@fns.com). This file was intended
for separate release, put Paul has kindly agreed to fold it in.
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI>a file of terms sent to me by Jerry Suppan. (I lost all trace of who
sent me the file. Then in July 2002 I bumped into Jerry in Tokyo, and
he reminded me.)
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI>other terms I have collected along the way;
</LI>
</OL>
In preparing this file, I have used the following to help prepare &amp;
check entries:
<UL>
<LI>the Kodansha "Great Japanese Dictionary", which is available in 
Electronic Book format, and which I have been able to use on-line.
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI>Gene Ferber's "Dictionary of Computer &amp; Data-Processing Terms", 
(Tuttle, 1990)
<P>
</P>
</LI>
<LI>a file of Microsoft glossary information for the Japanese versions of 
Win95, etc. (This has not been a lot of use, but occasionally is good
for cross-checking.)
</LI>
</UL>
Many thanks to Jean-Jacques Labarthe for many corrections to the 
file. Thanks also to Paul Denisowski and Gururaj Rao for their valuable
contributions.
